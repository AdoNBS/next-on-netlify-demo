This is a demo of a NextJS application with Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

View the demo: [https://next-on.netlify.com](https://next-on.netlify.com)

The demo is hosted on Netlify. Minimal configuration required thanks to [the next-on-netlify npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-on-netlify). next-on-netlify makes server-side rendering possible by using Netlify functions under the hood.
